### Hi there üëã
# Welcome to My GitHub!

Hello! I'm a current MSCS student at NYU's Courant Institute, deeply rooted in the AI field with a strong background in deep learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and data science. I have an unwavering curiosity about the limits of human and machine intelligence, sparked by the historic victory of Alpha GO.

## Research and Projects üß†

### Published Papers:

1. **GARCH Analysis of COVID-19 Impact on SMEs**
   - Analyzed the volatility of SMEs during the pandemic using the GARCH model and the Chinese GEM Index.
   
2. **Agriculture and Chinese GDP: An In-depth Machine Learning Analysis**
   - Explored the relationship between agricultural productivity and China's economic growth using machine learning.

3. **Ransomware Detection in Cryptocurrency Transactions: A Code Companion**
   - Addressed the detection of ransomware in cryptocurrency transactions through a multistage machine learning framework.

4. **Metaheuristic Optimization with Machine Learning for TSP**
   - Improved the Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem by integrating elite genes identified through a decision tree model.

(An additional project on training a PPO agent in Super Mario Bros is underway and has not been published yet.)

### Unpublished Work:

5. **Super Mario Bros PPO Agent**
   - Trained a PPO agent to play Super Mario Bros, enhancing the understanding of optimization and reinforcement learning.

## My Ambition üåü

My journey through the MSCS program at NYU's Courant Institute has been transformative, steering my focus towards **Data Mining** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** within the realm of Machine Learning. I am enthralled by the intricacies of extracting meaningful patterns from large datasets and the challenge of enabling machines to understand and interpret human language.

As I delve into advanced topics and collaborate with renowned faculty, I am honing my skills in these areas to become a proficient **Machine Learning Engineer** specializing in Data Mining and NLP. With a robust portfolio of research and academic projects, I am actively looking for roles that will leverage my expertise to tackle complex data-driven challenges.

I am eager to contribute to the field of AI by developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between theoretical AI frameworks and practical, impactful applications. If you are seeking a passionate and dedicated individual to enrich your team's technical prowess, let's connect!


## Seeking Opportunities üõ†Ô∏è

I'm currently on the lookout for job opportunities that will allow me to grow and contribute as a machine learning engineer. With a solid foundation in algorithm development and a track record of published research, I am ready to take on the challenges of the industry.
